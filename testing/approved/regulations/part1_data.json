The technical document for these guidelines is available on <a href=\"http://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/environmental-workplace-health/reports-publications/water-quality.html\">Water Quality - Reports and Publications</a>. This document was publicly consulted for 60 days in 2023 and was updated taking into consideration the comments received.</p>\n<p>December 27, 2024</p>\n<p><strong>Greg Carreau</strong> <br/>\r\n        Director General<br/>\r\n        Safe Environments Directorate<br/>\r\n        On behalf of the Minister of Health</p>\n<h3>ANNEX</h3>\n<h4>Guideline</h4>\n<p>An aesthetic objective (AO) of ≤ 0.1 mg/L (100 Âµg/L) is established for total iron in drinking water.</p>\n<h4>Executive summary</h4>\n<p>This guideline technical document was prepared in collaboration with the Federal-Provincial-Territorial Committee on Drinking Water and assesses all available information on iron.</p>\n<h4>Exposure</h4>\n<p>Iron is a ubiquitous metal in the environment originating from both natural sources and human activities. It occurs mostly in the form of organic and inorganic compounds and, to a lesser extent, in its metallic form. People in Canada are exposed to iron mainly through food and, to a lesser extent, through drinking water, principally because of corrosion in the distribution system or from groundwater supplies. Exposure through drinking water contributes less than 10% of the total daily iron intake.</p>\n<h4>Health effects</h4>\n<p>Iron is an essential element for humans. However, short-term oral exposure to very high levels of supplemental iron (&gt;30 mg/day as nonheme iron) or of ingested iron from all sources (total iron intake &gt;45 mg/day) may cause adverse health effects, with gastrointestinal distress being the most sensitive endpoint. The overall weight of scientific evidence indicates that iron is not a reproductive toxicant, a developmental toxicant, or a carcinogen.</p>\n<h4>Aesthetic considerations</h4>\n<p>Concerns about iron in drinking water are often related to consumer complaints regarding discoloured water. The AO of ≤ 0.1 mg/L (100 Âµg/L) is intended to minimize the occurrence of discoloured water due to the presence of iron oxides and to improve consumer confidence in drinking water quality.</p>\n<h4>Analytical and treatment considerations</h4>\n<p>The development of a drinking water guideline takes into consideration the ability to measure the contaminant and to remove it from drinking water supplies. Several analytical methods are available for measuring iron in water at concentrations well below the AO.</p>\n<p>At the municipal level, treatment technologies that are available to effectively decrease iron concentrations in drinking water include aeration, chemical oxidation, and coagulation followed by granular or membrane filtration, as well as adsorption, and biological filtration. Most well-operated and optimized treatment plants can achieve iron concentrations of 0.1 mg/L or less in the treated water. The AO of ≤ 0.1 mg/L would minimize the occurrence of discoloured water and taste complaints, aid in the removal of co-occurring Mn, ensure that a disinfectant residual is maintained and improve consumer confidence in drinking water quality. Prior to full-scale implementation, bench- and/or pilot-scale studies should be conducted using source water to ensure sufficient iron removal and to optimize performance.</p>\n<p>In cases where iron removal is desired at a small-system or household level, for example, a private well, a residential drinking water treatment unit may be an option. Certified residential treatment units for the removal of iron from drinking water are currently available.</p>\n<h4>Distribution system</h4>\n<p>The implications of the accumulation and release of iron and co-occurring contaminants of health concern (such as arsenic, lead, manganese and radiological contaminants) in distribution systems have been well documented. Iron corrosion by-products can also deplete the disinfectant residual. It is recommended that water utilities develop a distribution system management plan to minimize the release of iron and the potential for co-occurring contaminants in the system.</p>",
